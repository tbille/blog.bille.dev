I would like to start writing more.

I decided to open this blog to force myself to do it. This blog will gather a collection of micro posts about recent discoveries that I've made.

A lot of it might be obvious for many but helpful for others. I hope that you will find cool tips.

I will also take the opportunity to learn more about managing and sharing content. Hopefully I will be able to share as openly as I can information.

Let's see where this brings me! ðŸ‘¾
