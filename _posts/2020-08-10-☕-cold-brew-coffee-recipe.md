**TL;DR** 750 ml of water + 50 grams of coarse ground coffee, infused for 12 hours. Serve in a glass with ice, filling half the glass with the coffee infusion and the other half with of water.

It is pretty warm at the moment in London. It gets more and more difficult to drink warm coffee like dripped coffee. I recently got a cold brew coffee pot from [Hario](https://www.hario.co.uk/collections/coffee-brew-cold-brew/products/cold-brew-coffee-pot-medium). I thought it would be a good time to share my recipe.

The coffee that I used comes from the roaster [Square Mile](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/) in East London. It is a Costa Rican, very sweet beans, perfect for such temperatures.

For the recipe: go for a 1:15 ratio. With this Hario coffee pot use: **750 ml of water** and **50 grams of coffee** coarsely ground. Leave the coffee infusing in the water for 12 hours at room temperature in the coffee pot.

Once the infusion is done, remove the coffee and compost it. The coffee can be served! Serve in a glass with **5 ice blocks** with **half water** and **half infusion**.

Enjoy!
